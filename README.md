# DGRP_Project_DworkinLab
This is a project that was a part of my MSc work at the Dworkin Lab. I ask how variation in gene expression in developing wing tissue relates to varaition in adult wing shape, exploring this question using multivariate linear models, vector correlations, and permutation tests. In this repository is code for data processing, statistical analysis, and plotting figures.

* DGRP gene expression data from Yu Xin Shi and Dr. Jason Mezey at the Mezey Lab
* DGRP wing shape data from Dr. Will Pitchers at the Dworkin lab
* Supervised by Dr. Ian Dworkin
