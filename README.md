# DGRP_Project_DworkinLab
Code for a project that was a part of my MSc work at the Dworkin Lab. I ask how variation in gene expression in developing wing tissue relates to varaition in adult wing shape.

DGRP gene expression data from Yu Xin Shi and Dr. Jason Mezey at the Mezey Lab
DGRP wing shape data from Dr. Will Pitchers at the Dworkin lab
